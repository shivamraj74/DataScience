    "File handle is like a cursor, which defines from where the data has to be read or written in the file. There are 6 access modes in python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Read Only (‘r’) : Open text file for reading. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. If the file does not exists, raises I/O error. This is also the default mode in which file is opened.\n",

    "Read and Write (‘r+’) : Open the file for reading and writing. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. Raises I/O error if the file does not exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write Only (‘w’) : Open the file for writing. For existing file, the data is truncated and over-written. The handle is positioned at the beginning of the file. Creates the file if the file does not exists.\n",
